This repo is intendent for developers. If you want to play the mod, please download it from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minefortress-rts) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/minefortress).

## For Developers
### Prerequisites
I assume that everyone who wants to contribute to the project is familiar with Java/Kotlin development in general.
I won't go in details of installing basic developer setup, but I will list all the tools that are required to work with the project:
* Java 17 - I prefer using [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) builds 
* IntelliJ IDEA - For the most convenient development experience and to get the results matching my results, I recommend using IntelliJ IDEA. You can download it [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
* Git - To clone the repository and to commit your changes. You can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

If you need some support in setting up your developer environment, please read articles located here: [Java development with IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/getting-started.html)

Feel free to ask for help in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/6rt7VJxPcq).
### Getting started / Installation
1. Clone the repository using Git.
2. Make sure that the project is cloned in the directory named `minefortress`. This is required to make Gradle work properly with IDEA.
3. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
4. Wait for Gradle to finish importing the project.
5. We still need to make Run Configurations work. Fabric plugin will do it automatically, but we need to close the project.
6. Close the project and open it again.
7. New Run Configurations should appear. If they don't, try to restart IDEA.
8. Run Configuration may have small cross near it. It means that Fabric plugin used wrong module when setting up the configuration.

9. To fix it, edit the configuration and select `minefortress.main` module classpath dropdown.

10. Now you can run the project using the `Minecraft Client` configuration.
